# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Wonkle?

Wonkle is an LLC (Limited Liability Company) based in South Korea founded by
[pomp](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/15691003) that builds gaming hardware such as tablets and keypads
for games like osu! and various FPS games. It builds everything in the open under
[OSI-Approved Hardware and Software Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses).
Wonkle is also a community of builders that together build the best hardware for gamers.

## When will (Product name) be available?

All of our products are still under development. Our first tablet is estimated to hit the market
sometime during 2026. Development Status & Roadmap (WIP) will come soon.

## What makes the Wonkle tablets special?

Wonkle tablets are capable of a much higher polling rate (~25x) than other drawing tablets.
This means, you'll get many more inputs per second which is important for gamers.

## How can I contribute?

Start by reading the [contribution guide](/docs/contribution-guide) and joining our
[Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/h27rwcBn73).

You can also financially support us through [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/wonkle).

## Isn't 8000Hz polling rate too much?

8000Hz polling rate can be overwhelming for many computers. We are providing this option so those
who can benefit from it can chose to use it. We recommend that you adjust the device's polling
rate to match your use case using our web-based configuration tool (WIP).

## What are target specs for the tablets?

_Hall effect tablet_

- Polling rate: 8000Hz
- Digitizer dimensions: TBD
- Digitizer resolution: TBD

_EMR tablet_

- Polling rate: 1000Hz
- Active area dimensions: TBD

## How do I configure the tablet?

_General settings_

You can use OpenTabletDriver to configure the tablet. This includes using any of the many plug-ins
available for OpenTabletDriver.

_Wonkle-specific settings_

There are settings that are unique to Wonkle tablets that are not available in OpenTabletDriver.
One example of such a setting is adjusting the polling rate.
For these settings you will use a special Wonkle-specific configuration app.
This wonkle-specific app is available as both (1) a web-based user experience and (2) a local
standalone experience.

## Which operating systems do Wonkle tablets support?

Wonkle tablets work on Windows, MacOS, and Linux - every operating system that OpenTabletDriver
supports.
